# Scanner Status

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Last Updated:** 2026-05-08
**Status:** Active

## Overview

One row per scanner shipping in production. Tracks: language, scan kind, project type tested, current image version (from `scanner-versions-configmap.yaml`), last-known-good baseline, most recent end-to-end verification, current status, and open issues.

**Status legend:**
- ✅ working — produces findings on a known-vulnerable fixture
- ❌ broken — cluster-verified failure
- ⚠️ inconclusive — last verification ran on a fixture that does not match baseline; needs re-test against baseline fixture before declaring broken
- 🚧 fix-in-progress — open changelog entry, fix not yet verified

## Verification fixtures

Use the same fixtures as the 2026-05-04 baseline so status comparisons stay valid. Same-fixture comparison is the only honest evidence of regression — different fixtures = different code paths = inconclusive.

| Language | Single-file fixture | Project fixture |
|---|---|---|
| Solidity | `0c7542c6` (single-file OZ) | `eafe2b12` (Foundry+OZ multi-file) |
| Vyper | `8d5bea5f` (E2E-Vyper-Ownable) | `a355b720` (E2E-Vyper-tokens-tree) |
| Rust/Solana | n/a (most Solana scanners require project context) | `86096252` (E2E-Rust-anchor-basic1-tree) |

Fixture sources: contracts already imported into `jasonbrailowbizop@mail.com`'s account from prior audit cycles. Do not introduce new throwaway fixtures unless the row is being explicitly retired or added.

## How to verify a scanner

1. Authenticate to Supabase as `jasonbrailowbizop@mail.com` → exchange for JWT.
2. Either (a) reuse an existing baseline contract by `contract_id` from the table above, or (b) `POST /api/v1/upload` with the same fixture file.
3. `POST /api/v1/scans` with `{ "contract_id": <uuid>, "scan_type": "full", "scanner_ids": ["<one>"], "scan_source": "cli" }`.
4. Poll `GET /api/v1/scans/{scan_id}` until `status` is `completed` or `failed`. Pull `GET /api/v1/scans/{scan_id}/vulnerabilities?limit=1000`.
5. Update this scanner's row (current status, last verified, scan_id) AND add a `CHANGELOG.md` entry — same commit.
